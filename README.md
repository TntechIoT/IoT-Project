# IoT-Project
The IoT 3D print monitoring system for the imakerspace 
This project receives data from multiple sensors and displays them
in order to identify failed prints early and stop them.
Some of our code:
Test_piezo.py: py code for hosting piezo vibration sensor
Acc.py: py code for accelerometer
Azure.py: py code for MS Azure cloud services
Dht1.py: py code for humidity-temperature sensor
